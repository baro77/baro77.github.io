Dear reader,

I'm writing this post to inform you that from late evening of November 13th, 2021 
[Google Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics){:target="_blank"} has been activated on _www.byBaro.it_. I kept it disabled when I opened the site on March 2021, because of a maximalist attitude towards privacy; however I have been missing a way to get feedback about visits, so the present decision.

This blog doesn't explicitly collect any visitors' information, while of course some "technological" data is inevitably provided using it, e.g. the source IP and some browser infos. So my educated guess is that reading this site isn't more harmful to privacy than generic Internet navigation, but if you don't agree I can suggest you to [contact me](https://www.bybaro.it/me/){:target="_blank"} to check together if a different balance can be reached; if that's not an option, at least you know the terms to be able to decide if (sadly) stop reading this blog... hope not!

Further changes regarding these topics will be highlighted by future posts like this one and/or on page [Hereabouts](https://www.bybaro.it/hereabouts){:target="_blank"}.

Thanks for being here, 
regards

Andrea Baro
