If you like the look & feel of this space the merit is all of [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie){:target="_blank"}: as stated by its creator,

> _Reverie is a Jekyll-powered theme which is simple and opinionated. It's actually a fork of jekyll-now with some additional features and personal touches which I've implemented to suit my needs for my blog._

It also fits very easily with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="_blank"}: a must for me, given that "www.byBaro.it" is a [GitHub page with custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site){:target="_blank"}. Web, CMS, static generators are definitely not my field: I have been doing only minor changes to the original theme, just to accommodate needs when they appear.

Google Analytics is on by default on Reverie, and I have initially disabled it; I activated it on November, 13th 2021 to have feedback on visits, but I deactivated it again on January, 25th 2022 due to Austrian Datenschutzbehörde notes. Further changes, if any, will be listed here and on dedicated posts (like these ones: [1](https://www.bybaro.it/GAactivation/), [2](https://www.bybaro.it/GAdeactivation/)). 

Domain MX was handled by Proton till December 2025; after that, due to discontent with their refund policy and multi-years customer handling, I switched email handling to an Apple's iCloud custom domain. Of course I still own my pubkey/privkey pair: honestly I never use email encryption (apart from automatically with other Proton users), so I'm still evaluating what to do with them... actually, and if not otherwise said, I deprecate their use; but if you still have and will use my PGP public key, my educated guess is that I'll be able to decrypt, read, answer it :) 
At same time of email provider changed I also brushed up my DMARC policy and I played a bit with BIMI (but not certified yet, so just a geeky test. 

So these are the technical merits awarded to who deserves them; instead I'm the only guilty one about posts contents! ;)
