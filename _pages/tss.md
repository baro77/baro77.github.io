The Salmon Series (_TSS_ for short) is a group of infographics born from the hand-notes I have been taking while studying Monero's inner workings.

I begun to read _Mastering Monero_ in early 2020 driven by that "Mastering" in the title: coming from _Mastering Bitcoin_ I was searching for an introductory, still catching-all resource about the coin (at that time my only knowledge about Monero was coming from crypto news aggregators, depicting it as a maybe controversial project but for sure very dynamic and brave to raise the bar of anonimity, continuously improving tech in a _best-is-enemy-of-good_ fashion). It has been the fall in the rabbit's hole, and soon I was digging into _Zero to Monero: Second Edition_ as well and other resources, available online in large numbers thanks to the community-based nature of the project.

Soon I perceived an understandable lack of uniformity in offered documentation (as almost always happens with many, loosely harmonized contribs), and given my learning style -not well suited to a lot of formalism to be reconciled- I had to take my recapping notes:

The next step has been to think that my notes could be useful to someone else dealing with my same difficulties, so _The Salmon Series_ started with a first cheatsheet made publicly available in late 2020. Of course the idea of the _series_ has come much later, as the "_salmon_": it derives from employed colours, having semantic meanings (even if weak, e.g.: private vs. public, properties degrees, ...) but also a unifying function as a recurring theme, and remembering salmon browning (from raw to well-done) to the my eyes :)

## aka Andrea Barontini

Hi, thanks for reaching out to me! Condensed in just one headline, I'm an IT and networking professional, crypto & blockchain enthusiastic, science and tech hungry guy. 

A bit longer, I'm one of those late-70ies guys grown up with C=64 and Lego bricks, cutting his fingertips due to unfriendly frames of 90ies x86 assembled PCs, geek about technology and deeply fashinated by theoretical physics. I work as network specialist in the IT staff of an university, and I spend a large amount of my spare time cultivating my interests. Here it is a self-portrait of me, from 90ies ;) 

Online I'm active (with various degrees of involvement) on many platforms: this domain has to be intended as my own service-agnostic contents container, and as authoritative public entry point to reach me. Its name comes from early 90ies as well (what's better than teenagehood?!): "Baro" was -and still is- my nickname since high school times, given the local habit to obtain them shortening surnames.
