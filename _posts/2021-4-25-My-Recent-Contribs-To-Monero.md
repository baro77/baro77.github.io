My first real post devoted to my last quarter contributions to Monero project:
two cheatsheets:

- the first a recap of various keys, addresses, scopes (private/public, spend/view, on-chain/off-chain, payer’s/payee’s) and their relations: [https://github.com/baro77/MoneroAddressesCS](https://github.com/baro77/MoneroAddressesCS) and [Medium companion article]()

- the second a visual-holic journey through Rings flavours, from legacy signature to CLSAGs, presenting their core properties step-by-step: [https://github.com/baro77/RingsCS](https://github.com/baro77/RingsCS) and [Medium companion article](https://baro77.medium.com/ring-signatures-cheatsheet-e0abb8174757)

Their PRs having been accepted, both of them are also available on official [getmonero.org > Resources > Library > Cheatsheets](https://www.getmonero.org/library/)
