A last year child-of-the-lockdown long post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@baro77/quadratic-payments-with-constrained-probabilities-b40facba716), recently rewritten in [LaTeX](https://github.com/baro77/quadratic_influence/tree/master/LATEX) to use a typesetting environment more suitable for that kind of content, now announced on [arXiv:2104.12700 cs.GT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12700):

## Quadratic Payments with constrained probabilities

### Abstract
Dealing with quadratic payments, marginal probability is usually considered ideally constant, maybe for the sake of initial simplicity. Considering the voting scenario depicted in "Quadratic Payments: A Primer" by Vitalik Buterin, firstly its math foundations are made explicit. Developing a simple referendum model, more realistic outcome probability and marginal probability qualitative shapes are introduced. Enforcing seemingly reasonable assumptions, quadratic payments are then generalized to take into account these new functions shapes, and the way they are still quadratic is discussed. Closing remarks underline the emerging of trade-off constraints not existing in ideal case.
