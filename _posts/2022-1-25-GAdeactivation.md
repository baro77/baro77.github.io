Dear reader,

this post to update the status of 
[Google Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics){:target="_blank"} utilization on these pages.
Due to the compliance problems of GA with European GDPR noticed by Datenschutzbeh√∂rde (the Austrian Data Protection Authority), I have decided to suspend its usage.
Now I don't know if and when I'll reactivate it or other analytics solutions, but I'll follow the international debate about this topic and for sure any further change regarding my site will be advertised in posts like this one. 

My best regards,
Andrea Baro
