After the previous cheatsheets about [Monero Addresses](https://www.bybaro.it/My-Recent-Contribs-To-Monero/){:target="_blank"}, [Ring Signatures](https://www.bybaro.it/My-Recent-Contribs-To-Monero/){:target="_blank"}, [Monero's RingCT](https://www.bybaro.it/Moneros-RingCT-Cheatsheet/){:target="_blank"}, the intention was to write the next one about Bulletproof (the "_to be continued..._" of the third infographic). However very soon it has been clear that Zero Knowledge Proofs theory is mandatory to have a comprehensive understanding about how BP works (apart from being a very interesting field by itself, laying foundations for many cool techs): so I have authored and uploaded on GitHub [this new cheatsheet](https://github.com/baro77/ZKbasicsCS){:target="_blank"}, as a step of an ongoing documentation effort.

I have tried to not miss the basic core concepts despite the simplified approach and topics selection, stressing ideas more than formalism: the merit of this cheatsheet, if any, is trying to represent an at-hand, concise, first bridge between theoretical foundations and applications developers approaching this world (not necessarily cryptography professionals). Of course this kind of resource cannot be a rigorous reference, but authoritative sources that I have consulted are listed (just a few names: Goldreich, Green, Yundell), to let the interested reader dig deeper: definitely not an easy task, but worth the study the cited sources require.

Even if [this poster](https://github.com/baro77/ZKbasicsCS){:target="_blank"} stems from a specific, Monero-related documentation work, it's agnostic and dealing only with theory without any reference to actual projects: so of more general interes, I hope.
